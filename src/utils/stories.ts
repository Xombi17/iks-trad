    content: `Long ago in a small village in India, there lived a wise grandmother who kept a Tulsi plant in her courtyard. She taught her granddaughter about its healing powers - how its leaves could cure coughs, boost immunity, and bring peace to the mind. The plant was considered so sacred that the family would light a lamp near it every evening.

One day, when a terrible fever spread through the village, the grandmother used Tulsi leaves to make a healing tea that helped many villagers recover. From that day forward, every home in the village began growing their own Tulsi plant, understanding its role as a protector of health and wellness.

This is why even today, you'll find Tulsi plants in many Indian homes, continuing the ancient tradition of natural healing.`,

    content: `Deep in the forests of India lived an old tribal healer named Amrit who knew the healing properties of every plant and tree. One day, a young girl named Maya came to learn from him. She was impatient at first, wanting to learn everything quickly.

Amrit took Maya on daily walks through the forest, teaching her to observe each plant carefully. "Every leaf tells a story," he would say. He showed her how neem leaves could heal skin problems, how turmeric root could fight infections, and how different herbs could be combined to create powerful medicines.

Through seasons of patient learning, Maya understood that true healing wisdom comes not just from knowing the plants, but from respecting and understanding nature's delicate balance.`,

    preview: "Discover how the neem tree became nature's pharmacy.",
    content: `In a drought-stricken village, there stood a magnificent neem tree that had survived for hundreds of years. The villagers called it the 'Miracle Tree' because its leaves, bark, and seeds could cure many ailments.

A young boy named Ravi was curious about why animals would come to rub against the tree's bark when they were sick. He observed how birds would pick its leaves, and how insects avoided the plants growing under its shade.

His grandfather explained how their ancestors discovered each of the tree's healing properties - its leaves for skin problems, its bark for dental health, and its seeds for creating healing oils. Ravi learned that the neem tree was nature's own pharmacy, freely offering its healing gifts to all who needed them.`,
